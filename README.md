# GLHF
 This is the GLHF Esports website demo page.  We have a homepage, about, events calendar, gallery of event photos, and games the group plays.  There is a simple login feature that has yet to be completed.
 
 We are using Node, Express, Express Sessions, cookie parser, body-parser, and a MySQL connection module.  We wrote our own database code.  To implement the database, simply run the user_table_creation.sql file against your MySQL database. 
 
 This was created by Patrick Nucci, Tim Strickler, and Sam Weir during our Web App Development class at Point Park University between October and December 2018.  Further work will be done after class ends.  There are still many features that remain unfinished.
